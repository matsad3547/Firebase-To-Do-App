##Firebase To-Do App

This is a To-Do app with a terrible name that I built to try and learn how to use Firebase and Router, along with React.  The master branch actually works great.

There is also a branch with Router that uses React-Router and also works well, though it has a bug when deleting the list that you're on.  What I realized building it is that using Router really makes it difficult to have a global state, so I would really want to implement Redux on this app.
